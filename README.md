# Scuffed-Utils

This is the official repo for the infomous Scuffed-Utils project (I regret this name). 

The goal of this project is to remake the original gnu coreutils in python.  Why you 
may ask? Honestly, I don't know. One day I just got this Idea that, "Why not make scuffed
versions of the already great gnu coreutils programs (I still don't know what it is actually
called, oh well)". If you are interested in this project or are just doing drugs (like I am)
or both, then you may consider donating your juicy, yummy yummy code to this repository.

yeah, I know that the honestly is misspleled but I like it (By that I mean I don't want to fix it).

This project is far far from over. Here are the things we still have to implement in the currently implemented scuffed programs (sgrep.py).
