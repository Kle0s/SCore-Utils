This is the official repo for the infamous Scuffed-Utils project (I regret this name). 

The goal of this project is to remake the original gnu coreutils in python.  Why you 
may ask? Honestly, I don't know. One day I just got this Idea that, "Why not make scuffed versions of the already great gnu coreutils programs". If you are interested in this project, then you may consider donating your code to this repository.
